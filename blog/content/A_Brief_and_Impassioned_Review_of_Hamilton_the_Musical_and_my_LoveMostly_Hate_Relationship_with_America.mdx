### A Brief and Impassioned Review of Hamilton the Musical and my Love/Mostly Hate Relationship with America

Here me out. I love black washing US history. We all know [Beethoven was black](https://qwelian.com/posts/Notes_on_Being_Black_and_100_Amazing_Facts_About_the_Negro).
I am convinced [Pushkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin#Death) only ever really fired on [Dâ€™anthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_d%27Anth%C3%A8s)
after Dâ€™anthes used the n word, alledgedly. I am not here to provide [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Poet), Iâ€™m just saying
I can go all day with black washing history but Hamilton has reveled most of it is wishful thinking. Like of course Pushkin didnâ€™t fye on Dâ€™anthes for the n world,
allegedly. My spite for European treatment ofâ€¦ a lot, kinda ruins my love for black washing history. At least as much as any other order to restrict freedom kinda ruins
the fun of history. My grandmother didnâ€™t pick cotton as a child because of the Ottomans though.

While listening to [Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yspbNBIWsF0&pp=ygUIaGFtaWx0b24%3D) I cannot exist in a position where viewing the events unfolding are
unconditionally positive for me. I mean at best Aaron Burr gives life to an [abolitionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pierre_Burr), alledgedly. Meanwhile Hamilton
at the side of a man with slave teeth. How that work?? I do not wanna hear you one more time king. Boooo!!!! Beat it!!! You got teeth to remove from your slaves. Go home roger!

Now I say all that but my moral high ground is kinda ruined when Lin Manuel Miranda says his name is Alexander Hamilton. I mean this is worlds [longest running democracy](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/countries-are-the-worlds-oldest-democracies/).
They did not explicitly write race and class into the Bill of Rights technically, which is like kinda cool, maybe a low bar given liberty being a pretty important thing then, alledgedly.
But the shit slap. The example Washington set by leaving office was revolutionary in an era of [Bolivars](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/2016/06/504-the-prince-of-caracas.html)
and (Napoleons [one](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/2015/09/354-the-empire.html) and [two](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/2018/04/733-what-the-heck-just-happened.html)).
This _is_ the worldâ€™s longest lived democracy!

By the time raisse your glasss to freeeedom comes on Iâ€™m in. For just a second I feel patriotic. And I am like â€œis this what white people feel all the time???? like they belong to a historical struggle for freedom
rooted in the founding of the US???? Then itâ€™s back to massive [anti](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights?state=") trans legislationand me celebrating when 
Hamilton ruins his career writing a public letter talking about why he cheated on his wife. Thanks Hamilton for not talking less. THEN the bozo tells his son to attend a duel and NOT shoot. My man you a goof. 
Big goof Burr smoking on the Hamilton pack #PACKWATCH #RIPBOZO REST IN PISS YOU WON'T BE MISSED ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯

I suppose my favorite thing about the musical is that Hamilton is a goof and Burr is a dummy. I am moved to set the bar extremely low for large groups of people, especially us in America, which is cathartic.
