# A Brief and Impassioned Review of Hamilton the Musical and my Love/Mostly Hate Relationship with America

\\- Here me out\. I love black washing US history\. We all know \\[\[Beethoven\\] \(https://www\.qwelian\.com/pub/q98710sp/release/8"\>Beethoven\) was black\]\(%5Bhttps://www\.qwelian\.com/pub/q98710sp/release/8\)\. I am convinced \[Pushkin\]\(%5Bhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Alexander\_Pushkin\#Death\)\\]\(\[https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Alexander\\_Pushkin\#Death"\>Pushkin\]\(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Alexander\_Pushkin\#Death%22%3EPushkin\)\) only ever really fired on \\[\[Dâ€™anthes\]\(%5Bhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Georges\_d%27Anth%C3%A8s\)\\]\(\[https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Georges\\_d%27Anth%C3%A8s"\>Dâ€™anthes\]\(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Georges\_d%27Anth%C3%A8s%22%3ED%E2%80%99anthes\)\) after Dâ€™anthes used the n word, alledgedly\. I am not here to provide \\[\[proof\]\(%5Bhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Death\_of\_the\_Poet\),\\]\(\[https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Death\\_of\\_the\\_Poet"\>proof\]\(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Death\_of\_the\_Poet%22%3Eproof\),\) Iâ€™m just saying\.

\\- I can go all day with black washing history but Hamilton has reveled most of it is wishful thinking\. Like of course Pushkin didnâ€™t fye on Dâ€™anthes for the n world, allegedly\. My spite for European treatment ofâ€¦ a lot, kinda ruins my love for black washing history\. At least as much as any other order to restrict freedom kinda ruins the fun of history\. My grandmother didnâ€™t pick cotton as a child because of the Ottomans though\.

\\- While listening to \[Hamilton\]\(%5Bhttps://www\.youtube\.com/watch?v\=yspbNBIWsF0&pp\=ygUIaGFtaWx0b24%3D\)\\]\(\[https://www\.youtube\.com/watch?v\=yspbNBIWsF0&pp\=ygUIaGFtaWx0b24%3D"\>Hamilton\]\(https://www\.youtube\.com/watch?v\=yspbNBIWsF0&pp\=ygUIaGFtaWx0b24%3D%22%3EHamilton\)\) I cannot exist in a position where viewing the events unfolding are unconditionally positive for me\. I mean at best Aaron Burr gives life to an \[abolitionist\]\(%5Bhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/John\_Pierre\_Burr\),\\]\(\[https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/John\\_Pierre\\_Burr"\>abolitionist\]\(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/John\_Pierre\_Burr%22%3Eabolitionist\),\) alledgedly\.

\\- Meanwhile Hamilton at the side of a man with slave teeth\. How that work?

\\- I do not wanna hear you one more time king\. Boooo\!\!\!\! Beat it\!\!\! You got teeth to remove from your slaves\. Go home roger\.

\\- Now I say all that but my moral high ground is kinda ruined when Lin Manuel Miranda says his name is Alexander Hamilton\. I mean this is worlds longest running democracy\. They did not explicitly write race and class into the Bill of Rights technically, which is like kinda cool, maybe a low bar given the liberty a pretty important thing then, alledgedly\. But the shit slap\. The example Washington set by leaving office was revolutionary in an era of \[Bolivars\]\(%5Bhttps://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\_podcast/2016/06/504\-the\-prince\-of\-caracas\.html\)\\]\(\[https://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\\_podcast/2016/06/504\-the\-prince\-of\-caracas\.html"\>Bolivars\]\(https://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\_podcast/2016/06/504\-the\-prince\-of\-caracas\.html%22%3EBolivars\)\) and Napoleons\(\[one\]\(%5Bhttps://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\_podcast/2015/09/354\-the\-empire\.html\)\\]\(\[https://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\\_podcast/2015/09/354\-the\-empire\.html"\>one\]\(https://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\_podcast/2015/09/354\-the\-empire\.html%22%3Eone\)\) and \[two\]\(%5Bhttps://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\_podcast/2018/04/733\-what\-the\-heck\-just\-happened\.html\)\)\.\\]\(\[https://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\\_podcast/2018/04/733\-what\-the\-heck\-just\-happened\.html"\>two\]\(https://thehistoryofrome\.typepad\.com/revolutions\_podcast/2018/04/733\-what\-the\-heck\-just\-happened\.html%22%3Etwo\)\)\.\) This is the worldâ€™s longest lived democracy\. By the time raisse your glasss to freeeedom comes on Iâ€™m in\. For just a second I feel patriotic\. And I am like â€œis this what white people feel all the time???? like they belong to a historical struggle for freedom rooted in the founding of the US????â€œ

\\- Then itâ€™s back to massive \[anti\\]\(https://www\.aclu\.org/legislative\-attacks\-on\-lgbtq\-rights?state\="\>anti\) trans legislation\]\(%5Bhttps://www\.aclu\.org/legislative\-attacks\-on\-lgbtq\-rights?state\=\) and me celebrating when Hamilton ruins his career writing a public letter talking about why he cheated on his wife\. Thanks Hamilton for not talking less\. THEN the bozo tells his son to attend a duel and NOT shoot\. My man you a goof\. Big goof Burr smoking on the Hamilton pack\.

\\- \#PACKWATCH \#RIPBOZO REST IN PISS YOU WON'T BE MISSED ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤£

\\- I suppose my favorite thing about the musical is that Hamilton is a goof and Burr is a dummy\. I am moved to set the bar extremely low for large groups of people, which is cathartic\.
