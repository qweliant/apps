# The Price of Thinking is Increasing and I Like Opt\-in Data Sovereignty

Description: Thought \-\>Personal Thinking Apps \(Not Meant for Public Use\)

\#\# Gathering Metadata

One key idea is that gathering metadata for objects should be seamless\. Instead of requiring the manual formatting of default Markdown frontmatter—which can become tedious—metadata processing could be handled downstream\. This way, raw text could remain flexible while the metadata is generated and applied during data processing\.

Starting with an existing project might feel limiting in some ways, but it does provide a solid foundation—a skeleton, so to speak—that can be extended or restructured as needed\.

For now, the priority should be enabling the export of these notes to my blog with some reliable formatting being done on the server

\#\# Features and Functionality

I need to test how the system handles different types of content\. Ideally, I should be able to toggle between view modes for any given object\. A basic Markdown editor should be part of this system\. However, I don’t think I should optimize for static pages alone\. Instead, I should support multiple content types, such as:

\*   \*\*Canvas views\*\* for brainstorming and visual thinking
    
\*   \*\*Markdown editing\*\* for structured notes
    
\*   \*\*To\-do lists\*\* for task management
    
\*   \*\*Node views\*\* for scaling the graph
    

\#\# Packaging and Plugins

If I can package the editor with modular plugins, it might be possible to recreate a flexible, robust app\. However, I don’t need to build a perfect clone of any existing tool\. Instead, I’ll focus on creating a system that is easy for me to use and local first\. I dont know if the gov will come for our files so local first may go to p2p first\. More research is required\.

\#\# Use Cases

I might not rely on the 2b app for taking notes "on the fly," but the ability to format notes for specific use cases is important\. For example:

\*   Turning content outlines into Jekyll blog posts
    
\*   Using formatted notes to write plays, scripts, or other long\-form content \(similar to my workflow in Obsidian\)
    

Referencing across Markdown files is a must\(fun to think about too\), but more advanced features like transclusion will come later and require a distributed data structure to manage relationships\.

\#\# Tools and Inspirations

I essentially want a LogSeq/Tana node view with the ability to make a part of the node content editable markdown\. Moving towards logseq for the first few months seem more reasonable\. But i have objects and objects could be nodes so idk\. I may think about it or never get to it bc i dont think i need it\. Basic markdown exports is a good start

My inspiration and tools for thought include:

\*   \*\*Tana:\*\* I could replicate this using a personal version of Logseq, but I’d need support for supertags and a regular DOM\. If done well, this might eliminate the need for Obsidian entirely\.
    
\*   \*\*Obsidian:\*\* Still a cornerstone for long\-form thinking\.
    
\*   \*\*Apple Notes:\*\* I’m in the process of replacing this\.
    
\*   \*\*Email, Calendar, SMS:\*\* Transitioning to non\-big\-platform solutions\.
    
\*   \*\*Strong \(fitness app\):\*\* I want to recreate this functionality in a simple clone\.
    
\*   \*\*Apple Watch \+ health monitoring:\*\* The goal is to use SDK\-compatible devices\. My first app idea is a stress monitoring tool using HRV data\.
    

\#\# Goals

The overarching goals of this project are to:

1\.  Replace paid applications with self\-hosted or custom\-built solutions\.
    
2\.  Build tools that align better with my thought processes and specific workflows\.
    
3\.  Improve flexibility by enabling data and mentions to flow across different GUIs and contexts\.
    

While I’m not entirely sure what the end result will look like, I’m excited to experiment and see what I come up with\!
