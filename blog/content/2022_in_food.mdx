\\# Food Experiences 2021-2022

\\## 2021: KFG Brunch

\\- Ironically, this starts in 2021 with the KFG brunch during the fall.

I did not know I could like steak and I did not know the Caesar dressing from stores is a complete lie.

The meals we shared reinvigorated my enjoyment of food.

\## 2022: Spain

\\- 2022 started with bad meals throughout Madrid and Barcelona. Seriously Spain, what is this?

It’s not a tortilla, and it’s not good. The first time I ever had potatoes that soft encased in bread, though, made it memorable.

Let the Americas have tortillas and call this what it is: peasant casserole.

\### Potatas Bravas and Tapas

\\- The potatas bravas throughout Spain were inconsistent. To my palate, the tapas were hit or miss as well.

The exception was at Azimuth in the \\\[Almanac\\\](\[https://www.almanachotels.com/barcelona/food-drinks).\](https://www.almanachotels.com/barcelona/food-drinks\\).)

From the \\\[menu\\\](\[https://document-tc.galaxy.tf/wdpdf-eoz10mzsy1uyq5ng3ng6o88gj/food-menu.pdf\](https://document-tc.galaxy.tf/wdpdf-eoz10mzsy1uyq5ng3ng6o88gj/food-menu.pdf)), I recommend:

\\- Hummus

\\- Iberico ham

\\- Smoked fish

\\- Tataki

\\- Empanadas

\\- The Madrid (MAD) airport is one of my favorites, aesthetically, next to IST.

After losing Bekk many times looking for the right gate, we found \\\[Mas Q Menos\\\](\[https://www.masqmenos.com/portfolio/bocadillos/).\](https://www.masqmenos.com/portfolio/bocadillos/\\).)

The \\\*\_lomo de cerdo with crystal bread\_\* was the best meal in Spain for me.

\## Paris

\\- Paris was mostly average. On the first night, we had Urfa kabab with strangers at \\\[Urfa Durm\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/hhjxN8qb1wwhCpAS8\](https://goo.gl/maps/hhjxN8qb1wwhCpAS8)).

They made us feel at home in the city.

\\- Dinner at \\\[Bouillon Chartier\\\](\[https://www.bouillon-chartier.com/montparnasse/galerie-montparnasse/)\](https://www.bouillon-chartier.com/montparnasse/galerie-montparnasse/\\)) stood out for the staff and the duck.

\## Morocco

\\- Walking the Medina’s open markets led us to a hidden \\\[garage\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/Ht9Ekz9irzCzkCtb6\](https://goo.gl/maps/Ht9Ekz9irzCzkCtb6)).

The cooks served the best baked chicken I’ve ever had. They flattened the thigh and leg quarters for an even sear (I need a tagine!).

It was a rush of flavors that vindicated my earlier complaints about European food.

\## Amsterdam

\\- In Amsterdam, Bekk’s mac and cheese was the highlight.

I was grateful for the time inside our Airbnb, which helped me realize I must work on myself as a habit.

\\## Sanliurfa, Turkey

\\- Smoking \\\[hookah\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/QKyxgXpuBaciq32E6\](https://goo.gl/maps/QKyxgXpuBaciq32E6)) near \\\[Balıklıgöl\\\](\[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal%C4%B1kl%C4%B1g%C3%B6l)\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal%C4%B1kl%C4%B1g%C3%B6l\\)) under canopies was memorable.

The meal from \\\[Konak\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/L6nG7X4mtFfg93k4A\](https://goo.gl/maps/L6nG7X4mtFfg93k4A)) after visiting Gobekli Tepe was phenomenal.

\## Istanbul

\\- \\\[Tahin\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/jvxwg5kpnySKT9CAA\](https://goo.gl/maps/jvxwg5kpnySKT9CAA)), a Lebanese spot, does veggies very well.

\\- \\\[Handmade Burger Co.\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/WdeYfUNRWrNRDMTQ6\](https://goo.gl/maps/WdeYfUNRWrNRDMTQ6)) changed my opinion about burger joints.

\## Thailand

\\- Thailand is high on the food tier list.

At \\\[Factory Cafe\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/uVF6qY5fKBtFYRx7A\](https://goo.gl/maps/uVF6qY5fKBtFYRx7A)) in Ko Tao, I recommend the smoothies and veggies.

Nearby, a \\\[Chinese spot\\\](\[https://goo.gl/maps/K7rtRozFQoJCtXoe6\](https://goo.gl/maps/K7rtRozFQoJCtXoe6)) serves amazing dishes.

\\### 7-Elevens

\\- The 7-Elevens in Thailand amazed me.

A 13-year-old kid served me the best fried chicken I’ve ever had. Big shout out to him!

\## Chicago

\\- \\\*\_Gene and Judes and Jim’s Original\_\* are must-visits in Chicago.

Damali and I spent a working vacation enjoying these iconic spots.

\## Road Trip

\\- A road trip from Macon, GA to Cannon Beach, OR provided unforgettable food experiences.

\\### Highlights:

\\- \*\_Triplets Food Mart\_\*, Baton Rouge: Possibly the best fried chicken.

\\- \*\_Sabas\_\*, New Orleans: Tapas with KFG, real hummus, and great conversations.

\\- \*\_Voodoo Donuts\_\*, Vancouver, WA: Donuts delivered by my aunt Jo.

\\- \*\_Pizza A’ Fetta\_\*, Cannon Beach, OR: Solid pizza while enjoying solitude.

\\- \*\_Josephson’s Smokehouse\_\*, Astoria, OR: Transcendent lox.

\\- \*\_Urban Kitchen\_\*, Bozeman, MT: A much-needed respite after a rough day.

\\---
