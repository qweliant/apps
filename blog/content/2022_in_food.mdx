# 2022 in food

\# Food Experiences 2021-2022

\## 2021: KFG Brunch

\- Ironically, this starts in 2021 with the KFG brunch during the fall.

I did not know I could like steak and I did not know the Caesar dressing from stores is a complete lie.

The meals we shared reinvigorated my enjoyment of food.

## 2022: Spain

\- 2022 started with bad meals throughout Madrid and Barcelona. Seriously Spain, what is this?

It’s not a tortilla, and it’s not good. The first time I ever had potatoes that soft encased in bread, though, made it memorable.

Let the Americas have tortillas and call this what it is: peasant casserole.

### Potatas Bravas and Tapas

\- The potatas bravas throughout Spain were inconsistent. To my palate, the tapas were hit or miss as well.

The exception was at Azimuth in the \[Almanac\]([https://www.almanachotels.com/barcelona/food-drinks).](https://www.almanachotels.com/barcelona/food-drinks\).)

From the \[menu\]([https://document-tc.galaxy.tf/wdpdf-eoz10mzsy1uyq5ng3ng6o88gj/food-menu.pdf](https://document-tc.galaxy.tf/wdpdf-eoz10mzsy1uyq5ng3ng6o88gj/food-menu.pdf)), I recommend:

\- Hummus

\- Iberico ham

\- Smoked fish

\- Tataki

\- Empanadas

\- The Madrid (MAD) airport is one of my favorites, aesthetically, next to IST.

After losing Bekk many times looking for the right gate, we found \[Mas Q Menos\]([https://www.masqmenos.com/portfolio/bocadillos/).](https://www.masqmenos.com/portfolio/bocadillos/\).)

The \*_lomo de cerdo with crystal bread_\* was the best meal in Spain for me.

## Paris

\- Paris was mostly average. On the first night, we had Urfa kabab with strangers at \[Urfa Durm\]([https://goo.gl/maps/hhjxN8qb1wwhCpAS8](https://goo.gl/maps/hhjxN8qb1wwhCpAS8)).

They made us feel at home in the city.

\- Dinner at \[Bouillon Chartier\]([https://www.bouillon-chartier.com/montparnasse/galerie-montparnasse/)](https://www.bouillon-chartier.com/montparnasse/galerie-montparnasse/\)) stood out for the staff and the duck.

## Morocco

\- Walking the Medina’s open markets led us to a hidden \[garage\]([https://goo.gl/maps/Ht9Ekz9irzCzkCtb6](https://goo.gl/maps/Ht9Ekz9irzCzkCtb6)).

The cooks served the best baked chicken I’ve ever had. They flattened the thigh and leg quarters for an even sear (I need a tagine!).

It was a rush of flavors that vindicated my earlier complaints about European food.

## Amsterdam

\- In Amsterdam, Bekk’s mac and cheese was the highlight.

I was grateful for the time inside our Airbnb, which helped me realize I must work on myself as a habit.

\## Sanliurfa, Turkey

\- Smoking \[hookah\]([https://goo.gl/maps/QKyxgXpuBaciq32E6](https://goo.gl/maps/QKyxgXpuBaciq32E6)) near \[Balıklıgöl\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal%C4%B1kl%C4%B1g%C3%B6l)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal%C4%B1kl%C4%B1g%C3%B6l\)) under canopies was memorable.

The meal from \[Konak\]([https://goo.gl/maps/L6nG7X4mtFfg93k4A](https://goo.gl/maps/L6nG7X4mtFfg93k4A)) after visiting Gobekli Tepe was phenomenal.

## Istanbul

\- \[Tahin\]([https://goo.gl/maps/jvxwg5kpnySKT9CAA](https://goo.gl/maps/jvxwg5kpnySKT9CAA)), a Lebanese spot, does veggies very well.

\- \[Handmade Burger Co.\]([https://goo.gl/maps/WdeYfUNRWrNRDMTQ6](https://goo.gl/maps/WdeYfUNRWrNRDMTQ6)) changed my opinion about burger joints.

## Thailand

\- Thailand is high on the food tier list.

At \[Factory Cafe\]([https://goo.gl/maps/uVF6qY5fKBtFYRx7A](https://goo.gl/maps/uVF6qY5fKBtFYRx7A)) in Ko Tao, I recommend the smoothies and veggies.

Nearby, a \[Chinese spot\]([https://goo.gl/maps/K7rtRozFQoJCtXoe6](https://goo.gl/maps/K7rtRozFQoJCtXoe6)) serves amazing dishes.

\### 7-Elevens

\- The 7-Elevens in Thailand amazed me.

A 13-year-old kid served me the best fried chicken I’ve ever had. Big shout out to him!

## Chicago

\- \*_Gene and Judes and Jim’s Original_\* are must-visits in Chicago.

Damali and I spent a working vacation enjoying these iconic spots.

## Road Trip

\- A road trip from Macon, GA to Cannon Beach, OR provided unforgettable food experiences.

\### Highlights:

\- \*_Triplets Food Mart_\*, Baton Rouge: Possibly the best fried chicken.

\- \*_Sabas_\*, New Orleans: Tapas with KFG, real hummus, and great conversations.

\- \*_Voodoo Donuts_\*, Vancouver, WA: Donuts delivered by my aunt Jo.

\- \*_Pizza A’ Fetta_\*, Cannon Beach, OR: Solid pizza while enjoying solitude.

\- \*_Josephson’s Smokehouse_\*, Astoria, OR: Transcendent lox.

\- \*_Urban Kitchen_\*, Bozeman, MT: A much-needed respite after a rough day.

### Recipe: Simple Salad

\- 2 cups of mixed greens

\- Spritz of lemon

\- Finishing oil

\- Red onion

\- Kosher salt

\- Freshly ground pepper

\- Feta crumbles

\- Optional: diced beets, blueberries, almonds, tangerines
