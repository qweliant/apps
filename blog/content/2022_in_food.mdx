# 2022 in food

\\# Food Experiences 2021\-2022

\\#\# 2021: KFG Brunch

\\- Ironically, this starts in 2021 with the KFG brunch during the fall\.

I did not know I could like steak and I did not know the Caesar dressing from stores is a complete lie\.

The meals we shared reinvigorated my enjoyment of food\.

\#\# 2022: Spain

\\- 2022 started with bad meals throughout Madrid and Barcelona\. Seriously Spain, what is this?

It’s not a tortilla, and it’s not good\. The first time I ever had potatoes that soft encased in bread, though, made it memorable\.

Let the Americas have tortillas and call this what it is: peasant casserole\.

\#\#\# Potatas Bravas and Tapas

\\- The potatas bravas throughout Spain were inconsistent\. To my palate, the tapas were hit or miss as well\.

The exception was at Azimuth in the \\[Almanac\\]\(\[https://www\.almanachotels\.com/barcelona/food\-drinks\)\.\]\(https://www\.almanachotels\.com/barcelona/food\-drinks\\)\.\)

From the \\[menu\\]\(\[https://document\-tc\.galaxy\.tf/wdpdf\-eoz10mzsy1uyq5ng3ng6o88gj/food\-menu\.pdf\]\(https://document\-tc\.galaxy\.tf/wdpdf\-eoz10mzsy1uyq5ng3ng6o88gj/food\-menu\.pdf\)\), I recommend:

\\- Hummus

\\- Iberico ham

\\- Smoked fish

\\- Tataki

\\- Empanadas

\\- The Madrid \(MAD\) airport is one of my favorites, aesthetically, next to IST\.

After losing Bekk many times looking for the right gate, we found \\[Mas Q Menos\\]\(\[https://www\.masqmenos\.com/portfolio/bocadillos/\)\.\]\(https://www\.masqmenos\.com/portfolio/bocadillos/\\)\.\)

The \\*\_lomo de cerdo with crystal bread\_\\* was the best meal in Spain for me\.

\#\# Paris

\\- Paris was mostly average\. On the first night, we had Urfa kabab with strangers at \\[Urfa Durm\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/hhjxN8qb1wwhCpAS8\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/hhjxN8qb1wwhCpAS8\)\)\.

They made us feel at home in the city\.

\\- Dinner at \\[Bouillon Chartier\\]\(\[https://www\.bouillon\-chartier\.com/montparnasse/galerie\-montparnasse/\)\]\(https://www\.bouillon\-chartier\.com/montparnasse/galerie\-montparnasse/\\)\) stood out for the staff and the duck\.

\#\# Morocco

\\- Walking the Medina’s open markets led us to a hidden \\[garage\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/Ht9Ekz9irzCzkCtb6\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/Ht9Ekz9irzCzkCtb6\)\)\.

The cooks served the best baked chicken I’ve ever had\. They flattened the thigh and leg quarters for an even sear \(I need a tagine\!\)\.

It was a rush of flavors that vindicated my earlier complaints about European food\.

\#\# Amsterdam

\\- In Amsterdam, Bekk’s mac and cheese was the highlight\.

I was grateful for the time inside our Airbnb, which helped me realize I must work on myself as a habit\.

\\#\# Sanliurfa, Turkey

\\- Smoking \\[hookah\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/QKyxgXpuBaciq32E6\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/QKyxgXpuBaciq32E6\)\) near \\[Balıklıgöl\\]\(\[https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Bal%C4%B1kl%C4%B1g%C3%B6l\)\]\(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Bal%C4%B1kl%C4%B1g%C3%B6l\\)\) under canopies was memorable\.

The meal from \\[Konak\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/L6nG7X4mtFfg93k4A\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/L6nG7X4mtFfg93k4A\)\) after visiting Gobekli Tepe was phenomenal\.

\#\# Istanbul

\\- \\[Tahin\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/jvxwg5kpnySKT9CAA\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/jvxwg5kpnySKT9CAA\)\), a Lebanese spot, does veggies very well\.

\\- \\[Handmade Burger Co\.\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/WdeYfUNRWrNRDMTQ6\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/WdeYfUNRWrNRDMTQ6\)\) changed my opinion about burger joints\.

\#\# Thailand

\\- Thailand is high on the food tier list\.

At \\[Factory Cafe\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/uVF6qY5fKBtFYRx7A\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/uVF6qY5fKBtFYRx7A\)\) in Ko Tao, I recommend the smoothies and veggies\.

Nearby, a \\[Chinese spot\\]\(\[https://goo\.gl/maps/K7rtRozFQoJCtXoe6\]\(https://goo\.gl/maps/K7rtRozFQoJCtXoe6\)\) serves amazing dishes\.

\\#\#\# 7\-Elevens

\\- The 7\-Elevens in Thailand amazed me\.

A 13\-year\-old kid served me the best fried chicken I’ve ever had\. Big shout out to him\!

\#\# Chicago

\\- \\*\_Gene and Judes and Jim’s Original\_\\* are must\-visits in Chicago\.

Damali and I spent a working vacation enjoying these iconic spots\.

\#\# Road Trip

\\- A road trip from Macon, GA to Cannon Beach, OR provided unforgettable food experiences\.

\\#\#\# Highlights:

\\- \\*\_Triplets Food Mart\_\\*, Baton Rouge: Possibly the best fried chicken\.

\\- \\*\_Sabas\_\\*, New Orleans: Tapas with KFG, real hummus, and great conversations\.

\\- \\*\_Voodoo Donuts\_\\*, Vancouver, WA: Donuts delivered by my aunt Jo\.

\\- \\*\_Pizza A’ Fetta\_\\*, Cannon Beach, OR: Solid pizza while enjoying solitude\.

\\- \\*\_Josephson’s Smokehouse\_\\*, Astoria, OR: Transcendent lox\.

\\- \\*\_Urban Kitchen\_\\*, Bozeman, MT: A much\-needed respite after a rough day\.

\\- 2 cups of mixed greens

\\- Spritz of lemon

\\- Finishing oil
