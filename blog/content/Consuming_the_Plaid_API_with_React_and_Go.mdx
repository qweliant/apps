### A Modern Full Stack REST Application

Plaid is a popular API that exposes a user's banking information through REST endpoints. We will make use of their service to create a REST API to create authorization information. We will then create a React application that consumes the API to create auth tokens for a user. Remember, you can click on the \*_View Raw_\* button to copy any code you need. This tutorial assumes familiarity with React and full-stack development. The repo for this can be found here:

\*_A quickstart for setting up Plaid server and React client - qweliant/BetterPlaidQuickstart_\*

To get started, we need to head over to Plaid for our API keys.

#### Landing page after login to Plaid

Navigate to the \*_Settings tab and click Keys_\* to view your API keys.

#### Creds from Plaid

We will use the sandbox environment, which uses a different key for testing than development. Notice on the left sidebar a tab that says \*_API. Click on that and you will see the section about Plaid's redirect URI. Click on Add New URI and add_ `http://localhost:80` _and_ `http://localhost:3000`_. This will control where the redirect after linking happens. If you click on the Test in Sandbox_\* button seen on the landing page, you will be taken to a page showing the test user credentials.

Quickstart repos exist for multiple languages. You can use your language of choice for this project since the client is backend agnostic.

We won't necessarily run the exact setup they have, but next, we will walk through setting up the backend via the \*_Go Not So Quickstart Repo_\*.

### Backend

1\. Create a project directory for your project. Then run:

\`\`\`bash

git clone [https://github.com/plaid/quickstart.git](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart.git)

\`\`\`

2\. Delete the \*_Makefile, README, and every folder except the go_\* one.

#### Before

_files present_

#### After

_files remaining_

These come preconfigured with a Dockerfile to make deployment easy. We won't be covering deployment of Docker containers, but we will be spinning them up using Docker for Desktop. If you need to install, check out Docker for installation instructions per your OS. This will be a simple Docker setup, so you should be able to understand the basics following along.

The next thing we should do is edit the \*_docker-compose.yml_\* file. We need to remove the container setup procedures for the other examples and make environment variables available from a `.env` file. After the edits, the file should look like this:

\`\`\`yaml

version: "3.4"

services:

go:

build:

context: .

dockerfile: ./go/Dockerfile

ports:

\- "8000:8000"

env\_file:

\- .env

\`\`\`

Running:

\`\`\`bash

docker-compose up -d --build

\`\`\`

will build the image and start a container. If we look at the Dockerfile, we can see how our application is being built. The Go version is specified for the official Go image. A directory is created that we copy everything into. After changing the root directory to the Go folder, we get the required packages and build the binary.

Next, we pull the image that our binary will run on, copy the binary into the image, and expose the app via port 8000. By the way, you should delete the lines that copy HTML and static info over. Our Dockerfile should look like this:

\`\`\`dockerfile

FROM golang:1.12 AS build

WORKDIR /opt/src

COPY . .

WORKDIR /opt/src/go

RUN go get -d -v ./...

RUN go build -o quickstart

FROM [gcr.io/distroless/base-debian10](//gcr.io/distroless/base-debian10)

COPY --from=build /opt/src/go/quickstart /

EXPOSE 8000

ENTRYPOINT \["/quickstart"\]

\`\`\`

If you ran the above \*_docker-compose command, you should expect to see warnings about your env variables or errors if you have not already deleted the HTML and static copy. Let's create an .env file in the same folder as the docker-compose_\* file. This file will define your Plaid credentials. The result should be something like this:

\`\`\`env

\# Get your Plaid API keys from the dashboard: [https://dashboard.plaid.com/account/keys](https://dashboard.plaid.com/account/keys)

PLAID\_CLIENT\_ID=CLIENT\_ID

PLAID\_SECRET=SANDBOX\_SECRET

PLAID\_ENV=sandbox

PLAID\_PRODUCTS=transactions

PLAID\_COUNTRY\_CODES=US,CA

PLAID\_REDIRECT\_URI=[http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

\`\`\`

The last thing we should do before moving on to the frontend is edit some portions of the code in \*_server.go_\*. This is because the quickstart repo does not behave as one would expect. This may be due to my own ignorance, but following the steps in the official repo leads to an environment error.

\### Edit the following in \*_server.go_\*:

\`\`\`go

var (

PLAID\_CLIENT\_ID = os.Getenv("PLAID\_CLIENT\_ID")

PLAID\_SECRET = os.Getenv("PLAID\_SECRET")

PLAID\_ENV = os.Getenv("PLAID\_ENV")

PLAID\_PRODUCTS = os.Getenv("PLAID\_PRODUCTS")

PLAID\_COUNTRY\_CODES = os.Getenv("PLAID\_COUNTRY\_CODES")

PLAID\_REDIRECT\_URI = os.Getenv("PLAID\_REDIRECT\_URI")

APP\_PORT = os.Getenv("APP\_PORT")

)

var environments = map\[\_string\_\]plaid.Environment{

"sandbox": plaid.Sandbox,

"development": plaid.Development,

"production": plaid.Production,

}

func init() {

_// set defaults if_

if PLAID\_PRODUCTS == "" {

PLAID\_PRODUCTS = "transactions"

}

if PLAID\_COUNTRY\_CODES == "" {

PLAID\_COUNTRY\_CODES = "US"

}

if PLAID\_ENV == "" {

PLAID\_ENV = "sandbox"

}

if APP\_PORT == "" {

APP\_PORT = "8000"

}

if PLAID\_CLIENT\_ID == "" {

log.Fatal("PLAID\_CLIENT\_ID is not set. Make sure to fill out the .env file")

}

if PLAID\_SECRET == "" {

log.Fatal("PLAID\_SECRET is not set. Make sure to fill out the .env file")

}

_// create Plaid client_

client, err = plaid.NewClient(plaid.ClientOptions{

PLAID\_CLIENT\_ID,

PLAID\_SECRET,

environments\[PLAID\_ENV\],

&http.Client{},

})

if err != nil {

panic(fmt.Errorf("unexpected error while initializing plaid client %w", err))

}

}

\`\`\`

Now we can proceed with the React setup.

### React

Alright, we're back, refreshed, hydrated, and ready for the frontend. Start the app by running:

\`\`\`bash

npx create-react-app plaid

\`\`\`

The directory should be in the parent folder of your \*_go_\* folder.

Let's add the client service to the \*_docker-compose file. Add it after the go_\* section. The file will change to look something like this:

\`\`\`yaml

version: "3.8"

services:

go:

env\_file:

\- .env

build:

context: .

dockerfile: ./go/Dockerfile

ports:

\- "8000:8000"

restart: on-failure

client:

stdin\_open: true

env\_file:

\- .env

build:

context: .

dockerfile: ./plaid/Dockerfile

ports:

\- 80:80

restart: on-failure

\`\`\`

Next, create a \*_Dockerfile in the plaid_\* directory. This Dockerfile defines steps for building the production React app and placing it on an Nginx web server. The Dockerfile for this will be:

\`\`\`dockerfile

_\# STAGE 1 - build the react app_

FROM node:alpine as build

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./package.json /app/

RUN yarn --silent

COPY . /app

RUN yarn build

_\# STAGE 2 - build the final image using a nginx web server_

FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

COPY nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d

EXPOSE 80

CMD \["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"\]

\`\`\`

Then, create a folder named \*_nginx and add a file named nginx.conf_\*. This file configures the server to serve the static build (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.) on port 80 in the container.

\`\`\`nginx

server {

listen 80;

location / {

root /usr/share/nginx/html;

index index.html index.htm;

try\_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;

}

error\_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;

location = /50x.html {

root /usr/share/nginx/html;

}

}

\`\`\`

Now, run the \*_docker-compose_\* command to verify that the React app is being hosted on port 80. Since the redirect URI is needed for browser navigation after login, you'll need to resolve the URI for dev vs. container environments.

We now need to add \*_axios and react-plaid to handle state and client/server communication. Inside the plaid_\* directory, run:

\`\`\`bash

yarn add axios react-plaid-link

\`\`\`

Then, create a file named \*_Link.js inside the src_\* folder. This is where the logic for making the link will be created.

\`\`\`javascript

import React, { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";

import { usePlaidLink } from "react-plaid-link";

import axios from "axios";

import qs from "qs";

_const_ tokenURL = `http://localhost:8000/api/create_link_token`;

_const_ sendTokenURL = `http://localhost:8000/api/set_access_token`;

_const_ Link = () => {

_const_ \[data, setData\] = useState("");

_const_ fetchToken = useCallback(_async_ () => {

_const_ config = {

method: "post",

url: tokenURL,

};

_const_ res = await axios(config);

console.log(res)

setData(res.data.link\_token);

}, \[\]);

useEffect(() => {

fetchToken();

}, \[fetchToken\]);

_const_ onSuccess = useCallback(_async_ (_token_, _metadata_) => {

_// send token to server_

_const_ config = {

method: "post",

url: sendTokenURL,

data: qs.stringify({ public\_token: token }),

headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },

};

try {

_const_ response = await axios(config);

console.log(response)

} catch (error) {

console.error(error);

}

}, \[\]);

_const_ config = {

token: data,

onSuccess,

};

_const_ { open, ready, err } = usePlaidLink(config);

if (err) return "Error!";

return (

<button \_onClick\_={() => open()} \_disabled\_={!ready}>

Connect a bank account

);

}

export default Link;

\`\`\`

After running:

\`\`\`bash

docker-compose up

\`\`\`

Your app should be running at `localhost:80`. Try it out and let me know if you encounter any issues!

Congrats! You are now on your way to implementing a fintech banking as a service application. Kinda like...BaaS...Ok ok. Thank you for viewing. Feel free to reach out to me on my social, or connect via linkedin. Have a wonderful day!
