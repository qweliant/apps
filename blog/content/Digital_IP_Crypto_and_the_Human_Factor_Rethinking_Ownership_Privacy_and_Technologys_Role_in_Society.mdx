# Digital IP, Crypto, and the Human Factor: Rethinking Ownership, Privacy, and Technology's Role in Society

In an earlier post I examined why people hyperfixate on technology. In the context of AI, it can be summed up as: why do we anticipate a world with AI overlords? In this post, I examine similar mechanisms regarding crypto futurist Timothy May. In this poorly

I’ve been fascinated by where systems meet and interact for years. I suppose this epoch of web development is concerned with surfacing various hypermedia as novel connections onto ourselves. As the internet matures, we’re seeing new [visions](https://medium.com/heptabase/my-vision-a-forgotten-history-67ee77e969da) of hypertext come to life. Not just in the "second brain" tools many of us use daily but in the future of [operating systems](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/040/) themselves. A mature hypertext system, I believe, will look something like what Alexander Obenauer envisions: a seamless web of linked and back-linked media that mirrors how we think. This move toward hypertext as a way of thinking brought me to Timothy May, a man whose ideas were as radical as they were flawed.

My yearly Alice in Wonderland tumble into the history of the internet began with the aforementioned post by Obenauer, which eventually led me to a [Project Xanadu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) wiki page, a Chip Morningstar [blog post](http://www.fudco.com/chip/tech.html), and the [vehemently racist]-(https://scruz.general.narkive.com/29QgNUds/commie-rag-praises-mlk) nut job [Timothy May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_CMay)(fwiw, whenever I encounter characters like this, I secretly hope there's some deep state CIA plot to discredit people whose ideas threaten the political status quo. A person can dream, right?). [May’s ideas](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html), while radical and often problematic, raise important questions about hypermedia, technology, power, and societal change. But here’s the thing: technological innovation doesn’t automatically lead to societal collapse. It’s how we apply these tools—and for whose benefit—that truly matters. Instead of prophesying purely disruptive tech, we should look at linked and back-linked media as a model for governance. Something decentralized, but collectively shaped. Timothy May’s vision, at its core, is a constrained delusion. Crypto can’t just be seen as a disruptive force that needs immediate policing, or it’ll be crushed in the name of statecraft and a lack of imagination. While blockchain and crypto offer new ways to think about ownership and privacy, their success depends on addressing real human needs and behaviors.

When Marshall McLuhan said, “The medium is the message,” he urged us to consider not just what is being communicated, but how and why. Today, as we grapple with fears of technology “taking our jobs,” perhaps we should ask a deeper question: Why is our survival so tightly tied to labor in the first place? And if our response to automation is to destroy machines, shouldn't we direct that energy toward the systems forcing such false choices instead of [fighting to be feudal tenants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite#Peak_activity1811%E2%80%931817)?

This is precisely why I don't buy [federal futarchy](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/federal-futarchy). The dream of a perfectly rational governance model—whether dictated by markets, prediction algorithms, or benevolent bureaucrats—is just that: a dream. We're looking at you [Sofia Lamb](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Sofia_Lamb)…wait, are we? We are looking at you [Andrew Ryan](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Andrew_Ryan). Or maybe both. BioShock gives us two extremes: Lamb’s collectivist utopia, where the self is sacrificed to the whole, and Ryan’s hyper-individualist dystopia, where only the strong deserve to thrive (in our case, white). Both fail because governance isn’t about imposing a single, airtight ideology. In reality, governance is not about imposing blanket solutions but about navigating the messy, diverse needs of a society (we are apes though, so it’s probably about dominance and a homogenous ideological order). The conceit of many technological and political visions is that they promise simplicity in a world that is inherently complex. No system, whether a market, a state, or some hyper-rational algorithm, can fully capture the chaos of human life. Instead of clinging to ideological combat, perhaps we should focus on creating systems that adapt to and empower people.
