# Digital IP, Crypto, and the Human Factor: Rethinking Ownership, Privacy, and Technology's Role in Society

In an earlier post I examined why people hyperfixate on technology. In the context of AI, it can be summed up as: why do we anticipate a world with AI overlords? In this post, I examine similar mechanisms regarding crypto futurist Timothy May. In this poorly

I’ve been fascinated by where systems meet and interact for years. I suppose this epoch of web development is concerned with surfacing various hypermedia as novel connections onto ourselves. As the internet matures, we’re seeing new [visions]-(https://medium.com/heptabase/my-vision-a-forgotten-history-67ee77e969da) of hypertext come to life. Not just in the "second brain" tools many of us use daily but in the future of [operating systems](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/040/) themselves. A mature hypertext system, I believe, will look something like what Alexander Obenauer envisions: a seamless web of linked and back-linked media that mirrors how we think. This move toward hypertext as a way of thinking brought me to Timothy May, a man whose ideas were as radical as they were flawed.

My yearly Alice in Wonderland tumble into the history of the internet began with the aforementioned post by Obenauer, which eventually led me to a [Project Xanadu]-(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) wiki page, a Chip Morningstar [blog post]-(http://www.fudco.com/chip/tech.html), and a [vehemently racist]-(https://scruz.general.narkive.com/29QgNUds/commie-rag-praises-mlk).nut job named [Timothy May]-(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_CMay)(fwiw, whenever I encounter characters like this, I secretly hope there's some deep state CIA plot to discredit people whose ideas threaten the political status quo. A person can dream, right?). [May’s ideas]-(https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html), while radical and often problematic, raise important questions about hypermedia, technology, power, and societal change. But here’s the thing: technological innovation doesn’t automatically lead to societal collapse. It’s how we apply these tools—and for whose benefit—that truly matters. Instead of prophesying purely disruptive tech, we should look at linked and back-linked media as a model for governance. Something decentralized, but collectively shaped. Timothy May’s vision, at its core, is a constrained delusion. Crypto can’t just be seen as a disruptive force that needs immediate policing, or it’ll be crushed in the name of statecraft and a lack of imagination. While blockchain and crypto offer new ways to think about ownership and privacy, their success depends on addressing real human needs and behaviors.

When Marshall McLuhan said, “The medium is the message,” he urged us to consider not just what is being communicated, but how and why. Today, as we grapple with fears of technology “taking our jobs,” perhaps we should ask a deeper question: Why is our survival so tightly tied to labor in the first place? And if our response to automation is to destroy machines, shouldn't we direct that energy toward the systems forcing such false choices instead of [fighting to be feudal tenants]-(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite#Peak_activity1811%E2%80%931817)?

This is precisely why I don't buy [federal futarchy]-(https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/federal-futarchy). The dream of a perfectly rational governance model—whether dictated by markets, prediction algorithms, or benevolent bureaucrats—is just that: a dream. We're looking at you [Sofia Lamb]-(https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Sofia_Lamb)…wait, are we? We are looking at you [Andrew Ryan]-(https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Andrew_Ryan). Or maybe both. BioShock gives us two extremes: Lamb’s collectivist utopia, where the self is sacrificed to the whole, and Ryan’s hyper-individualist dystopia, where only the strong deserve to thrive (in our case, white). Both fail because governance isn’t about imposing a single, airtight ideology. In reality, governance is not about imposing blanket solutions but about navigating the messy, diverse needs of a society (we are apes though, so it’s probably about dominance and a homogenous ideological order). The conceit of many technological and political visions is that they promise simplicity in a world that is inherently complex. No system, whether a market, a state, or some hyper-rational algorithm, can fully capture the chaos of human life. Instead of clinging to ideological combat, perhaps we should focus on creating systems that adapt to and empower people.

## Privacy in Optimal Conditions

People are not concerned with privacy in optimal conditions. There isn't much I do in private or public that warrants true privacy. Most systems I contribute to digitally are not op secret. Anarchy should not equate to privacy, but should be an indicator of good actors. That is to say privacy should be a right, but not the only option. The use of a cryptographic network should indicate the health of governance. But to grow in real time we should absolutely treat privacy as a [right, not a privilege]-(https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/17/spideroak-founder-privacy-ethan-oberman-edward-snowden). Wikipedia is a pretty good model for collective knowledge creation. Most of our knowledge should not exist on Wikileaks, but the knowledge that does should be backed by zero-knowledge file storage services.

## The Problem with Digital IP and NFTs

I call May's vision constrained because he looks at anarchy as something that is immediately disenfranchising. Probably destructive. If we instead turn to the creative commons to model IP we may see the disenfranchisement of top down ownership. Taking that a step further, how might we ensure and enforce ownership without the involvement of a state? What if digital media were freely accessible, but with a robust system for attribution and tracking, similar to an open-source DMCA?

## Technology as a Specialized Tool

Its important to note here that all these are tools. Anarchy should account for radical self governance. Whistleblower blockchains should be a thing. But these tools do not solve for misuse. It is not my goal to frame these tools in such a way as to be responsible for bad actors. I am sure the internet is responsible for much harm. It should be policed. Anarchy should seek resolution amongst its communities, not top down. If a community sees the need for policing that community should have the tools to police itself. Maybe they should interact with communities who solve policing practices based on governance and collective intervention.

## Crypto Beyond Financial Markets

The market is the great discovery mechanism but do a plethora of yogurt options prove a countries democratic supremacy? [Do jeans]-(https://www.quora.com/Was-wearing-denim-jeans-allowed-in-the-Soviet-Union)?

## The Human Factor: Collaboration and Technology

I cant sip the punch though. These are just technical solutions to abstract problems driven by my ifeas. I would prefer some sort of. We have to remember more yogurt flavors doesn't equate to democratization. What I am getting at is there more ways to imagine the application of tool use then fear, privacy, and the evasion of taxes. That is not anarchy. Thats the expectation of oppression. Which is smart, I mean come on, we see whats happening in our country. Now is the time to seriously think privacy first. But is it really. Wont there always be a better tool user. Are our systems 100 percent fool proof? Who knows. I do know [anarchy and capitalism are probably incompatible]-(https://czasopisma.marszalek.com.pl/images/pliki/apsp/75/apsp7504.pdf). We probably should not have [assassination markets]-(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market#Assassination_Market_(assmkedzgorodn7o.onion)) (That damn Luigi tho.). I doubt May considers these systems as more than a way to escaping the tyranny paying for school lunches. Anarchy cannot be merely escaping tax systems. For May, I would imagine, Trump is an anarchical figure. Technology will not solve these issues. For they seem a part of our condition. What am I saying. Even in Amsterdam, another European country tired of it's immigrants, I would have a ball just being a gardener and working some random job. People do not value freedom nor imagination here. People value eating potatoes alone on some home stead they took from a Indigenous person. Trump wants to colonize Palestine and Israel lol. Would May agree with that so long as he didn't pay taxes and MLK day was removed from government holidays. Would May's anarchism dictate what holidays we celebrate and who we deem worthy of humanization. Could he have imagined that his view is just the mainstream alt-right opinion. I do not think so. I find the very fact that used anarchy in his constrained view difficult to understand. Double speak is hard for me to wrap my head around. Trying to understand a naive an unimaginative form of anarchy is like trying to understand how 2 + 2 = 5. But i have found worse in silicon valley. May's views are so far from any reasonable stance on cryptography because ideology exist above all. Ideology guides us toward our misconceived destinies. I find it disappointing. As we build the tools of the future, how can we ensure they serve humanity—not just the market? Nor hatred. How can we make hatred and market proof technology? I started with gardening.
